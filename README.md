# Minimal TF-IDF Search Engine

A minimal Python-based text search engine that uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to rank documents based on relevance.

This project demonstrates core Information Retrieval concepts including:
- Text preprocessing
- Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- Vector space model
- Cosine similarity

## Features
- Loads text files from a folder
- Builds TF-IDF vectors
- Ranks documents by relevance
- Interactive query mode

## Run
