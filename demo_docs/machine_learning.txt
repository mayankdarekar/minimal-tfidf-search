Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. At its core, it's about finding patterns. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning finds hidden structure on its own. Reinforcement learning takes a different approach entirely, where an agent learns by trial and error through rewards and penalties. Neural networks, inspired loosely by the human brain, have become the backbone of modern ML. Deep learning stacks multiple layers to handle complex tasks like image recognition and language translation. Overfitting is one of the biggest challenges — when a model performs great on training data but fails on new data. Techniques like dropout, regularization, and cross-validation help address this. Tools like PyTorch and TensorFlow have made building models more accessible than ever, but understanding the math behind gradient descent and backpropagation still matters.
