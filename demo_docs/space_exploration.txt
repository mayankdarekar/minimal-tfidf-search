Space exploration has always been driven by curiosity and the need to understand where we come from. The Apollo missions in the late 1960s were a turning point — humans actually walked on another world. Since then, robotic missions have done a lot of the heavy lifting. Rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance have been crawling across Mars, analyzing soil, searching for signs of ancient microbial life. SpaceX changed the game by making rocket boosters reusable, dramatically cutting the cost of getting to orbit. Now there's serious talk about permanent lunar bases and crewed Mars missions within this decade. The James Webb Space Telescope has been sending back images that push back our understanding of the early universe. Private companies are increasingly involved, which speeds things up but also raises questions about who owns what in space. One thing is clear — the next 20 years of space exploration will look nothing like the last 20.
