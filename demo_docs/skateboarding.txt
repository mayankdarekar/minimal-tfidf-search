Skateboarding started as something to do when the surf was flat. Kids in California bolted roller skate wheels to wooden planks and figured out the rest from there. By the 1980s it had its own culture, its own music, and its own way of seeing cities — every ledge, handrail, and stairset became something to skate. The ollie, invented by Alan Gelfand and refined by Rodney Mullen, unlocked everything. Once you can pop the board into the air without grabbing it, a whole world of tricks becomes possible. Street skating and vert skating developed their own communities and styles. The skateparks of today are incredible compared to what earlier generations had to work with. Skating became an Olympic sport in Tokyo 2020, which was controversial — a lot of skaters feel the whole point is that it exists outside mainstream sports. But younger skaters are pushing technical difficulty to levels that would have seemed impossible 10 years ago. The culture around it — the videos, the graphics, the music — is just as important as the tricks.
