True crime taps into something deeply human — the need to understand how people end up doing terrible things. The genre has been around forever, but podcasts gave it a new life. Serial in 2014 was a turning point, bringing millions of people into a format that felt like following a case in real time. Since then the space has exploded. Some shows focus on investigation, walking through evidence and interviews. Others go deeper into the psychology — what environment, what circumstances, what mindset leads someone to cross that line. Cold cases have benefited hugely from public attention. DNA databases and amateur sleuths have helped crack cases that sat unsolved for decades. The Golden State Killer was identified partly because of genealogy websites. There's valid criticism too — that the genre sometimes sensationalizes tragedy or ignores the victims in favor of making the perpetrator interesting. The best true crime reporting keeps the humanity of everyone involved at the center. It's a fine line between informing and exploiting, and not every show gets it right.
