Music is one of the few things that works on you even when you're not paying attention. A song can pull you back to a specific moment years later with no warning. The way genres evolve is fascinating — jazz came from blues, rock came from jazz, hip hop flipped everything by making rhythm the main event and sampling existing records to build something new. Producers like J Dilla changed what beats could sound like. Artists like Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar pushed what albums could say. Streaming changed the economics completely. Artists now need millions of plays to earn what a few thousand album sales used to bring in, which has pushed a lot of musicians toward touring and merchandise just to survive. But it also meant that anyone with a laptop and an interface can release music to a global audience overnight. Bedroom pop and hyperpop both came out of that shift. Live music is still irreplaceable though. There's a version of a song that only exists in a specific room on a specific night, and that's never getting recorded. The relationship between music and identity runs deep — what you listen to at 17 tends to stick with you in ways that are hard to fully explain.
