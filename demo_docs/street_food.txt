Street food is arguably the most honest form of cooking. No pretense, no tablecloths — just someone who has been making the same dish for years and knows exactly what they're doing. In Bangkok, pad thai from a street cart at midnight hits differently than any restaurant version. Mexico City's tacos al pastor, carved off a rotating spit, are a perfect food by almost any measure. Mumbai's vada pav — a spiced potato fritter in a bread roll — feeds millions of people every single day. What makes street food special is the repetition. These vendors make one or two things, thousands of times, until the process is completely dialed in. The best finds are usually not on any list. You follow the crowd, look for the longest queue of locals, and trust that someone who has been cooking the same dish for 30 years probably knows what they're doing. Traveling purely to eat street food is a completely legitimate way to see the world.
